== Pronunciation
[.big]#*cljonic* /klə-jŏn′ĭk/#

== Obligatory Word Definition

[.big]#*Laconic*#

* Expressing much in few words; brief and pithy; concise; brusque

== Detailed Documentation
Detailed documentation is available https://thecodesojourner.github.io/cljonic/[here].

== Motivation

NOTE: If you are interested in a Big-Machine *{cpp} Clojure* implementation see the https://github.com/jank-lang/jank[Jank] project.

____
"A large fraction of the flaws in software development are due to programmers not fully understanding all the
possible states their code may execute in. ... Programming in a functional style makes the state presented to your code 
explicit, which makes it much easier to reason about [(i.e., Fewer mistakes, and less debugging)] ...

No matter what language you work in, programming in a functional style provides benefits. You should do it whenever it 
is convenient, and you should think hard about the decision when it isn't convenient."

*Clojure* is one of the most expressive and concise programming languages. *Clojure* is *laconic* in nature. *Clojure* is an *immutable-by-default*, *practical* and *stable* *functional programming language* based on the *Lisp* programming language. Unfortunately, *Clojure* is not well suited for some programming domains. One example is the *embedded system* domain. Especially, *embedded system* domains with tight memory and cpu constraints that do not allow use of the *heap*, and that only offer *{cpp}* programming tools.

*{cpp}*, on the other hand, is kind of the opposite of *Clojure*. *{cpp}* is a language that *does not* tend to be *Laconic* in nature, and *does* tend to be *verbose* in nature.  Furthermore, *{cpp}* is not immutable-by-default, and it is not considered a functional programming language, although it has some functional-programming-oriented features like *lambdas* and standard libraries like *ranges*, *views*, *optional* and *expected*.  Finally, *{cpp}* is a *BIG* language that is constantly in flux, has a large and growing set of features, offers a lot of ways to do things, and makes it *easy to do things poorly*.

Most *embedded system developers* are not computer language experts, they do not have time to keep up with the latest *{cpp}* language features, and their educational background is *not* heavy in the nuances of optimal *Modern* *{cpp}* usage.  When it comes to the use of *Modern* *{cpp}*, they are often mostly *self-taught*, and have learned on the job.

Many *embedded system* projects *do not* require heavy use of the *{cpp}* features designed for memory and cpu utilization optimization. Many projects have a small amount of code that must be *finely tuned*, and quite a bit of code that is *not performance critical*.  

The motivation behind *cljonic* is to provide a *Clojure-esque* functional programming library for *{cpp}* embedded system developers that is *laconic*, *immutable-by-default*, *practical*, and *stable*.  *Cljonic* should also be *easy to learn and understand* and *easy to use properly* for the *safe* implementation of the *non-performance-critical* code of an *embedded system*.

== Desired Developer Experience
The *cljonic* developer should be able to write *safe* code that is *easy to read*, *easy to understand* and *easy to maintain*.  These goals will enable *embedded system* projects to be *completed more quickly*, with 
*fewer bugs*, and maintained and enhanced with *less long term effort*. 

== Implementation Characteristics

NOTE: The performance of these implementation characteristics should be acceptable if the *average collection size is small*, and the *cljonic* library is used for *non-performance-critical code*.

* In order to provide the *cljonic immutable-by-default* feature, and because the *heap* can't be used in the *targeted* embedded systems, *cljonic* uses copying.  

* In order to meet the *safe* Desired Developer Experience goal, *cljonic* does bounds checking on all collection accesses. 

== Required Resources
* *C++ 23*, or higher, for *Modern {cpp}* features
* *clang-format* for code formatting
* *cppcheck* for code analysis
* *doxygen* for code documentation
* *gcov* for code coverage analysis
* *genhtml* for code coverage analysis
* *lcov* for code coverage analysis
* *lizard* for code metrics
** https://github.com/terryyin/lizard
** According to the lizard documentation, it only supports C++14. Another tool that supports *Cyclomatic Complexity* and *Function LoC* would be better.
* *valgrind* for code analysis
